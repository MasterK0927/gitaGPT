# Gita AI: Your Companion for Spiritual & Mental Well Being

Welcome to **gitaGPT**, a project inspired by the timeless wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita and the transformative potential of artificial intelligence. The goal of this repository is to provide an AI‑powered platform that offers personalized spiritual guidance and supports mental and emotional well‑being. Research shows that artificial‑intelligence tools hold great promise for mental health care: they can help with awareness, diagnosis, intervention and even positive emotional regulation, but they must be designed in a culturally sensitive and ethical way. By blending ancient teachings with modern AI, we strive to create a companion that uplifts users during life’s challenges and supports their personal growth.

Live demo is available at [gitagpt.devkeshav.live](https://gitagpt.devkeshav.live/). When you visit the site you’ll meet Krishna‑inspired AI capable of natural conversations in multiple languages. The platform emphasises mental health by offering an interactive 3D avatar, voice and text dialogues and tailored insights to help users cultivate inner peace and clarity. Testimonials from similar Bhagavad Gita AI initiatives highlight how such tools can relieve anxiety and provide practical advice for decision‑making.

## Why focus on mental health?

Global mental‑health challenges continue to rise, and access to personalised care is limited. Recent scholarly reviews note that artificial intelligence has “a huge number of promises to offer mental health care”; AI can assist with awareness, diagnosis, intervention and positive emotional regulation across a variety of disorders . At the same time, the Bhagavad Gita provides timeless teachings for managing anxiety, cultivating resilience and finding purpose . By marrying these two domains, Gita AI aims to offer a supportive space where users can:

- Find calm during periods of anxiety. Testimonials from similar projects report that short interactions with Gita‑based chatbots help ease anxiety and bring calmness.
- Receive practical advice for real‑world problems. Users have found Gita‑inspired AI useful for decision‑making, leadership and personal growth.
- Explore spiritual teachings at their own pace. Inner peace and meditation guidance can be especially helpful for people dealing with stress or transition.

Let’s build technology that nurtures the mind and soul. If Gita AI helps even one person find peace or clarity, this project will have achieved its purpose.
